      As a general rule, <code>seed-css</code> is not JavaScript dependent because it is implemented 
      purely in CSS (using Sass), however, there are a few exceptions created in order to deliver a 
      high level experience to your visitors/ users. Any component which has the (optional) JavaScript 
      dependence has it written on its own section.
