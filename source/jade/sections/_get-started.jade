      Just before get started, please notice that <code class="primary">seed-css</code> was written with modern browsers in mind.
      That means it just has support for <b>IE9+</b> (which actually isn't a real modern browser ... but),
      <b>Chrome</b>, <b>Firefox</b> and <b>Safari</b>, besides mobile browsers. If you need support older browsers, this boilerplate
      may not help you, but, just in case, you're free to customize it and create your own CSS rules to
      make it supports those older browser versions.

    p.align-justify.
      The most first thing you need to do to start using <code class="primary" >seed-css</code>
      is import its CSS file into your pages. In order to get the right files, you can either
      <a href="https://github.com/AbtzLabs/seed-css" >fork</a> this project on Github, or
      just <a href="https://github.com/AbtzLabs/seed-css/archive/develop.zip" >download</a>
      the compressed project files to your computer.

    p.align-justify.
      After get the latest version of files, import it to your pages as the example below:

    .code-sample
      pre.prettyprint.lang-html.
        &lt;head &gt;
          ...
          &lt;link href="seed.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" &gt;
        &lt;/head&gt;
