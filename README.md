## A bit of it

Seed CSS has started as a personal CSS boilerplate in 2015, when I was used to use it as
the design foundation for my side-projects while avoiding common frameworks like Bootstrap.
When it was still a very modest bunch of classes placed together, a friend and coworker asked
me to also use it on his projects. That was the time I decided to open-source the boilerplate
and keep improving its content.

### Breaking changes from v2.x

Until the version `1.2.4` (the latest from `1.x`) there was no big changes on his style and
number of components. However, from version `2.x` many things has changed, including the file
structure, some tags from components and tons of bugs fixed.

If you are migrating from version `1.x` to `2.x`, please keep in mind that you are gonna need
to review (and eventually rewrite) part of your HTML implementation.

The reason why this breaking change was done is that it was really necessary to improve the
way files are delivered to you, making it more flexible and reducing the unnecessary code
from many components. E.g:

- Alerts
- Grids
- Tooltips
- Etc ...
